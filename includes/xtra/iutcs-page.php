Let us all just think for back for a moment. Man from the cradle of illiteracy, disease, death has walk passed thousand years to reach the era we are living in now. We can phrase a thousand of words, clatter around with our ever piercing, senile, shrewd piece of justice but we can think of only one answer-Technology, a word that has become a part our everyday life. The invention of computer only facilitates the ever growing acceleration and is taking it to an epic and enigmatic pinnacle where it glitters like a shining diadem. <b>IUTCS</b> has been emblazoned with an ever daunting task to put through their level best to prove their every worth. These would have been all to introduce <b>IUTCS</b> from the part of principal. For greater introduction,     <b>IUTCS</b> is honored to be the part of IUT & shout out loud about its knowledge and expertise that it can offer to the country, better to the world. <b>IUTCS</b> went on from its birth at '07- '08 and never had to look back .It is quite tough to go through every bit of details about <b>IUTCS</b>. We will try to give a brief glimpse of it. 
<br>
 <b>IUTCS</b> was born under the colossal support of Prof Dr. Imtiaz Hossain, Honorable Vice Chancellor of IUT along with Prof Dr. M.A. Mottalib, The Chief Patron of <b>IUTCS</b> ; who put on a band of vigorous IUTIANS to work. Their unnerving leadership and support gave immense strength to the inaugurating committee led by IUT'04, who not only led the ever enthusiastic IUTIANS but united the whole of IUT under one name. From its birth <b>IUTCS</b> hosted numerous successful events, Programming Competitions, Academic Aid Programs, Seminars, Higher Studies Counseling and much more. And just when one thought everything that could be done was done <b>IUTCS</b> took on their greatest endeavor, to bring out the inaugurating <b>1st Prime Bank IUT National ICT FEST</b> , making it a landmark for Bangladesh. Being the pioneer, the task was a daunting one. It was a stage for proving themselves, which they pulled off spectacularly. It was a gala event which bought out all the different ICT activities under one roof. Each and every of the 5 grand events starting from the Programming Contests to the Gaming Contests was a blockbuster. All together it was a congregation of inquisitive mind bonded with the symphony of intellect & enthusiasm. Hurdling down the same path came the second bang, which made the first one look like a dot in the horizon. The event was bigger and grander than any other event IUT had ever seen with over 1500 participants from over 50 universities and over 60 schools and colleges. This year <b>IUTCS</b> is going to launch the third edition of this amazing festival with plans to make it an awesome spectacle for all to witness. But there is no reason to think <b>IUTCS</b> is only organizing ICT Fests and nothing more! <b>IUTCS</b> still continues its regular activities with constant modifications to make them even better.
 <br> 
You can never get enough of <b>IUTCS</b> in one page. Only expect a new entourage of invention. <br><b>SO, STAY TUNED......</b>
